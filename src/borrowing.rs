//! You're working on implementing a health-monitoring system. As part of that, you need to keep track of users' health statistics.
//! You'll start with a stubbed function in an impl block as well as a User struct definition. Your goal is to implement the stubbed out method on the User struct defined in the impl block.

// TODO: remove this when you're done with your implementation.
